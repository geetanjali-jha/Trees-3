 * Approach: 
 * In this problem I have to check the tree is Symmetric or not. 
 * The approach checks if the tree is symmetric by comparing the left and right parts of the tree. 
 * If both sides are empty, they are symmetric, but if one side is empty and the other is not, itâ€™s not symmetric.
 * It compares the node values and then looks at their children.
